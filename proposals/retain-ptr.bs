# Motivation # {#motivation}

There are a wide variety of C and C++ APIs that rely on reference counting,
but either because of the language (C) or the age of the library (C++), they
are unable to be safely used with either `std::unique_ptr<T>` or
`std::shared_ptr<T>`. In the former case, there is no guaranteed way to make
sure the `unique_ptr` is the last instance (i.e., that it is *unique*), and in
the latter case, `shared_ptr` manages its own API. In addition, existing
intrusive smart pointers such as <a href="https://bit.ly/intrusive-ptr">
`boost::intrusive_ptr<T>`</a>, <a href="https://bit.ly/com-ptr">Microsoft's
`ComPtr<T>`</a>, or <a href="https://git.io/fCl9x">WebKit's aptly named
`WTF::RefPtr<T>`</a> do not meet the needs of modern C++ smart pointers or APIs.
This proposal attempts to solve these shortcomings in an extensible and future
proof manner, while permitting a simple upgrade path for existing project
specific intrusive smart pointers and providing the opportunity for value
semantics when interfacing with opaque interfaces.

Those that work on systems or tools that rely on reference counting stand to
benefit most from `retain_ptr`. Additionally, `retain_ptr` would be a benefit
to standard library implementers for types that *secretly* use intrusive
reference counting such as a coroutines capable future and promise.

If `retain_ptr` is added to the standard library, the C++ community would also
be one step closer to a non-atomic `shared_ptr` and `weak_ptr`, much like
Rust's `Rc<T>`.

A reference implementation of `retain_ptr`, along with examples of its use,
can be found on [[implementation|github]].

# Scope and Impact # {#scope}

`retain_ptr<T, R>` would ideally be available in the `<memory>` standard
header. It is a pure extension to the C++ standard library and can (more or
less) be implemented using any conforming C++14 or C++11 compiler with very
little effort. See the [[#specification]] for interface and behavior
details.

# Frequently Asked Questions # {#faq}

Several common questions regarding the design of `retain_ptr<T, R>` can be
found below.

## How does `intrusive_ptr` not meet the needs of modern C++? ## {#faq-1}

`boost::intrusive_ptr` has had nearly the same interface since its introduction
in 2001 by Peter Dimov. Furthermore, `boost::intrusive_ptr` has several
failings in its API that cannot be changed from without breaking compatibility.
When constructing a `boost::intrusive_ptr`, by default it increments the
reference count. This is because of its `intrusive_ref_count` mixin, which
starts with a reference count of 0 when it is default constructed. Out of all
the libraries I tried to look at, this was the one instance where an object
required it be incremented after construction. This proposal rectifies this
by permitting each traits instance to choose its default action during
construction.

Additionally, `boost::intrusive_ptr` does not have the ability to "overload"
its `pointer` type member, requiring some additional work when interfacing with
C APIs (e.g., `boost::intrusive_ptr<decltype(*declval<cl_mem>())>`). This
also precludes it from working with types that meet the *NullablePointer* 
named requirements (a feature that `unique_ptr` supports).

Furthermore, `boost::intrusive_ptr` relies on ADL calls of two functions:

 * `intrusive_add_ref`
 * `intrusive_release`

While this approach is fine in most cases, it does remove the ability to easily
"swap out" the actions taken when increment or decrementing the reference count
(e.g., setting a debugger breakpoint on a specific traits implementation, but
not on *all* traits implementations). This naming convention uses terms found
in Microsoft's COM. While this isn't an issue per se, it would be odd to have
functions with those names found in the standard.

## Why is it called `retain_ptr` and not `intrusive_ptr`? ## {#faq-2}

`retain_ptr` diverges from the design of `boost::intrusive_ptr`. It was decided
to change the name so as to not cause assumptions of `retain_ptr`'s interface
and behavior.

Some additional names that might be considered (for bikeshedding) are:

 * `extend_ptr`
 * `counted_ptr`
 * `borrow_ptr`
 * `mutual_ptr`
 * `joint_ptr`

Comedy Option:

 * `auto_ptr`

## Is `retain_ptr` atomic? ## {#faq-3}

`retain_ptr` is only atomic in its reference count increment and decrements
if the object it manages is itself atomic in its reference count operations.

## Does `retain_ptr` support allocators? ## {#faq-4}

`retain_ptr` itself does not support allocators, however the object whose
lifetime it extends can.


## Can `retain_ptr` be constexpr? ## {#faq-5}

Possibly. However, I question the usefulness for a constexpr capable intrusive
smart pointer, as most use cases are intended for non-constexpr capable
interfaces such as incomplete types and polymorphic classes. Additionally,
`retain_ptr` allows one to utilize value semantics on C and C++ APIs. If this
is desired in a constexpr context, one can simply use constexpr values (i.e.,
reference counting is not a necessary aspect of constexpr)

## Does `retain_ptr` adopt or retain an object on construction? ## {#faq-7}

The default action that `retain_ptr` takes on construction or reset is
determined by the `traits_type` for the `retain_ptr`. If the traits type
has a member named `default_action`, the `retain_ptr` will use that to delegate
to the correct constructor. If there is no type alias member named
`default_action`, the default operation is to *adopt* the object (i.e., it
does not increment the reference count during its construction). The
`default_action` type alias *must* be either `adopt_object_t` or
`retain_object_t`.

## Why provide `retain_object_t` and `adopt_object_t`? ## {#faq-8}

`retain_object_t` and `adopt_object_t` act as sentinel types to provide
explicit requests to either *extend* or *adopt* an object when constructing
or resetting a `retain_ptr`. This mostly comes into play when interacting
with APIs that return a borrowed (rather than a new) reference to an object
without increment its reference count.

Technically, an `enum class retain : bool { no, yes }` would be possible.
However, this would be the first time such an API is placed into the standard
library. Using a boolean parameter, as found in `boost::intrusive_ptr` is
unsatisfactory and does not help describe the operation the user is requesting.

The names of these sentinels are available for bikeshedding. Some other
possible names for `retain_object_t` include:

 * `retain_element_t`
 * `extend_element_t`
 * `retainobj_t`
 * `extendobj_t`

While `adopt_object_t` names include:

 * `borrow_object_t`
 * `borrow_element_t`
 * `borrowobj_t`
 * `adopt_element_t`
 * `adoptobj_t`

## Does `retain_ptr` overload the addressof operator? ## {#faq-9}

Originally, this proposal suggested `retain_ptr` might in some small edge case
require an overload for the addressof `operator &`. This was, with absolutely
no surprise, contentious and asked to be removed. However, Microsoft's
`ComPtr<T>` overloads the addressof operator for initializing it via C APIs
(i.e., APIs which initialize a pointer to a pointer). Since then, JeanHyde
Meneide's *out_ptr* proposal [[P1132]] was written and thus solves this slight
issue.

## Can `retain_traits` store state? ## {#faq-10}

No. Any important state regarding the object or how it is retained, can be
stored in the object itself. For example, if the reference count needs to be
external from the object, `std::shared_ptr` would be a better choice.

## Why not just wrap a `unique_ptr` with a custom deleter? ## {#faq-11}

This is an extraordinary amount of code across many existing libraries that
would not be guaranteed to have a homogenous interface. For example, using
`retain_ptr` with an OpenCL context object (without checking for errors in both
implementations) is as simple as:

```cpp
struct context_traits {
  using pointer = cl_context;
  static void increment (pointer p) { clRetainContext(p); }
  static void decrement (pointer p) { clReleaseContext(p); }
};

struct context {
  using handle_type = retain_ptr<cl_context, context_traits>;
  using pointer = handle_type::pointer;
  context (pointer p, retain_object_t) : handle(p, retain) { }
  context (pointer p) : handle(p) { }
private:
  handle_type handle;
};

```

Using the `unique_ptr` approach requires more effort. In this case, it is
twice as long to get the same functionality.

```cpp
struct context_deleter {
  using pointer = cl_context;
  void increment (pointer p) const {
    if (p) { clRetainContext(p); } // retain_ptr checks for null for us
  }
  void operator () (pointer p) const { clReleaseContext(p); }
};

struct retain_object_t { };
constexpr retain_object_t retain { };

struct context {
  using handle_type = unique_ptr<cl_context, context_deleter>;
  using pointer = handle_type::pointer;

  context (pointer p, retain_object_t) :
    context(p)
  { handle.get_deleter().increment(handle.get()); }

  context (pointer p) : handle(p) { }

  context (context const& that) :
    handle(that.handle.get())
  { handle.get_deleter().increment(handle.get()) }

  context& operator = (context const& that) {
    context(that.handle.get(), retain).swap(*this);
    return *this;
  }

  void swap (context& that) noexcept { handle.swap(that); }
    
private:
  handle_type handle;
};

```

As we can see, using `retain_ptr` saves effort, allowing us in most cases to
simply rely on the "rule of zero" for constructor management. It will also not
confuse/terrify maintainers of code bases where objects construct a
`unique_ptr` with the raw pointer of another (and *unique ownership* is not
transferred).

# Examples # {#examples}

Some C APIs that would benefit from `retain_ptr<T>` are

 * OpenCL
 * Mono (Assembly and Image types)
 * CPython
 * ObjC Runtime
 * Grand Central Dispatch

Inside the [[implementation]] repository is an extremely basic example of using
`retain_ptr` with Python.

## OpenCL ## {#examples-opencl}

As shown above, using `retain_ptr` with OpenCL is extremely simple.

```cpp
struct context_traits {
  using pointer = cl_context;
  static void increment (pointer p) { clRetainContext(p); }
  static void decrement (pointer p) { clReleaseContext(p); }
};

struct context {
  using handle_type = retain_ptr<cl_context, context_traits>;
  using pointer = handle_type::pointer;
  context (pointer p, retain_object_t) : handle(p, retain) { }
  context (pointer p) : handle(p) { }
private:
  handle_type handle;
};

```

## ObjC Runtime ## {#examples-objc}

Additionally, while some additional work is needed to interact with the rest of
the ObjC runtime, `retain_ptr` can be used to simulate ARC and remove its
need entirely when writing ObjC. This means that one could, theoretically,
write ObjC and ObjC++ capable code without having to actually write ObjC or
ObjC++.

```cpp
struct objc_traits {
  using pointer = CFTypeRef;
  static void increment (pointer p) { CFRetain(p); }
  static void decrement (pointer p) { CFRelease(p); }
};
```

## DirectX and COM ## {#examples-directx}

Because DirectX is a COM interface, it can also benefit from the use of
`retain_ptr` by simply using the same common traits interface used for all COM
objects. The following code is slightly adapted from Microsoft's GpuResource
class in the DirectX Graphics Samples. The current form of the code uses the
Microsoft provided `WRL::ComPtr`, however the point here is to show how
`retain_ptr` can work as a drop-in replacement for this type.

```cpp
struct com_traits {
  static void increment (IUnknown* ptr) { ptr->AddRef(); }
  static void decrement (IUnknown* ptr) { ptr->Release(); }
};

template <class T> using com_ptr = retain_ptr<T*, com_traits>;

struct GpuResource {

  friend class GraphicsContext;
  friend class CommandContext;
  friend class ComputeContext;

  GpuResource (ID3D12Resource* resource, D3D12_RESOURCE_STATES current) :
    resource(resource),
    usage_state(current)
  { }

  GpuResource () = default;

  ID3D12Resource* operator -> () noexcept { return this->resource.get(); }
  ID3D12Resource const* operator -> () const noexcept {
    return this->resource.get();
  }

protected:
  com_ptr<ID3D12Resource> resource { };
  D3D12_RESOURCE_STATES usage_state = D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_COMMON;
  D3D12_RESOURCE_STATES transitioning_state = D3D_RESOURCE_STATES(-1);
  D3D12_GPU_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS virtual_address = D3D12_GPU_VIRTUAL_ADDRESS_NULL;
  void* user_memory = nullptr;
};
```

## WebKit's RefPtr ## {#examples-webkit}

As a small demonstration of replacing existing intrusive smart pointers with
`retain_ptr` the author presents the following code from WebKit that uses the
existing `RefPtr` type, followed by the same code expressed with `retain_ptr`.
This is not meant to be a fully functionioning code sample, but rather what the
effects of a refactor to using `retain_ptr` might result in

```cpp
RefPtr<Node> node = adoptRef(rawNodePointer);
```

```cpp
auto node = retain_ptr<Node>(rawNodePointer, adopt_object);
```

# Technical Specification # {#specification}

A *retain pointer* is an object that extends the lifetime of another object
(which in turn manages its own dispostion) and manages that other object
through a pointer. Specifically, a retain pointer is an object *r* that stores
a pointer to a second object *p* and will cease to extend the lifetime of *p*
when *r* is itself destroyed (e.g., when leaving a block scope). In this
context, *r* is said to *retain* ``p``, and *p* is said to be a *self disposing
object*.

When *p*'s lifetime has reached its end, *p* will dispose of itself as it sees
fit. The conditions regarding *p*'s lifetime is handled by some count *c* that
*p* comprehends, but is otherwise not directly accessible to *r*.

The mechanism by which *r* retains and manages the lifetime of *p* is known as
*p*'s associated *retainer*, a stateless object that provides mechanisms for
*r* to increment, decrement, and (optionally) provide access to *c*. In this
context, *r* is able to *increment* ``c``, *decrement* ``c``, or access the *c*
of *p*.

Let the notation *r.p* denote the pointer stored by *r*. Upon request, *r* can
explicitly choose to increment *c* when *r.p* is replaced.

Additionally, *r* can, upon request, *transfer ownership* to another retain
pointer *r2*. Upon completion of such a transfer, the following postconditions
hold:

 - *r2.p* is equal to the pre-transfer *r.p*, and
 - *r.p* is equal to ``nullptr``

Furthermore, *r* can, upon request, *extend ownership* to another retain
pointer *r2*. Upon completion of such an extension, the following
postconditions hold:

 - *r2.p* is equal to *r.p*
 - *c* has been incremented by 1

Each object of a type ``U`` instantiated from the ``retain_ptr`` template
specified in this proposal has the lifetime extension semantics specified
above of a retain pointer. In partical satisfaction of these semantics, each
such ``U`` is ``MoveConstructible``, ``MoveAssignable``, ``CopyConstructible``
and ``CopyAssignable``. The template parameter ``T`` of ``retain_ptr`` may be
an incomplete type. (*Note: The uses of* ``retain_ptr`` *include providing
exception safety for self disposing objects, extending management of self
disposing objects to a function, and returning self disposing objects from a
function.*)

```cpp
class atomic_reference_count<T>;
class reference_count<T>;

class retain_object_t;
class adopt_object_t;

template <class T> struct retain_traits;

template <class T, class R = retain_traits<T>> class retain_ptr;

template <class T, class R>
void swap (retain_ptr<T, R>& x, retain_ptr<T, R>& y) noexcept;

template <class T, class R, class U>
retain_ptr<T, R> dynamic_pointer_cast (retain_ptr<U, R> const&) noexcept;

template <class T, class R, class U>
retain_ptr<T, R> static_pointer_cast (retain_ptr<U, R> const&) noexcept;

template <class T, class R, class U>
retain_ptr<T, R> const_pointer_cast (retain_ptr<U, R> const&) noexcept;

template <class T, class R, class U>
retain_ptr<T, R> reinterpret_pointer_cast (retain_ptr<U, R> const&) noexcept;

template <class T, class R, class S=R>
strong_ordering operator <=> (retain_ptr<T, R> const& x, retain_ptr<T, S> const& y) noexcept;
template <class T, class R>
strong_ordering operator <=> (retain_ptr<T, R> const& x, nullptr_t) noexcept;
template <class T, class R>
strong_ordering operator <=> (nullptr_t, retain_ptr<T, R> const& y) noexcept;
```

## `atomic_reference_count<T>` and `reference_count<T>` ## {#wording-mixins}

``atomic_reference_count<T>`` and ``reference_count<T>`` are mixin types,
provided for user defined types that simply rely on ``new`` and ``delete`` to
have their lifetime extended by ``retain_ptr``. The template parameter ``T`` is
intended to be the type deriving from ``atomic_reference_count`` or
``reference_count`` (a.k.a. the curiously repeating template pattern, CRTP).

```cpp
template <class T>
struct atomic_reference_count {
  friend retain_traits<T>;
protected:
  atomic_reference_count () = default;
private:
  atomic<uint_least64_t> count { 1 }; // provided for exposition
};

template <class T>
struct reference_count {
  friend retain_traits<T>;
protected:
  reference_count () = default;
private:
  uint_least64_t count { 1 }; // provided for exposition
};
```

## `retain_object_t` and `adopt_object_t` ## {#wording-sentinels}

``retain_object_t`` and ``adopt_object_t`` are sentinel types, with constexpr
instances ``retain_object`` and ``adopt_object`` respectively.

```cpp
namespace std {
  struct retain_object_t { constexpr retain_object_t () = default; };
  struct adopt_object_t { constexpr adopt_object_t () = default; };
  constexpr retain_object_t retain_object { };
  constexpr adopt_object_t adopt_object { };
}
```

## `retain_traits<T>` ## {#wording-traits}

The class template `retain_traits` serves the default traits object for the
class template `retain_ptr`. Unless `retain_traits` is specialized for a
specific type, the template parameter `T` must inherit from either
`atomic_reference_count<T>` or `reference_count`. In the event that
`retain_traits` is specialized for a type, the template parameter `T` may be
an incomplete type.

```cpp
namespace std {
  template <class T> struct retain_traits {
    static void increment (atomic_reference_count<T>*) noexcept;
    static void decrement (atomic_reference_count<T>*) noexcept;
    static long use_count (atomic_reference_count<T>*) noexcept;

    static void increment (reference_count<T>*) noexcept;
    static void decrement (reference_count<T>*) noexcept;
    static long use_count (reference_count<T>*) noexcept;
  };
}
```

> <br /><sup>2</sup> Postcondition: `ptr->count` has been incremented by 1.

## `retain_ptr<T>` ## {#wording-pointer}

The default type for the template parameter `R` is `retain_traits`. A
client supplied template argument `R` shall be an object with non-member
functions for which, given a `ptr` of type `retain_ptr<T, R>::pointer`, the
expressions `R::increment(ptr)` and `R::decrement(ptr)` are valid and has the
effect of retaining or disposing of the pointer as appropriate for that
retainer.

If the *qualified-id* `R::pointer` is valid and denotes a type, then
`retain_ptr<T, R>::pointer` shall be synonymous with `R::pointer`. Otherwise
`retain_ptr<T, R>::pointer` shall be a synonym for `element_type*`. The type
`retain_ptr<T, R>::pointer` shall satisfy the requirements of
*NullablePointer*.

```cpp
template <class T, class R=retain_traits<T>>
struct retain_ptr {
  using element_type = T;
  using traits_type = R;
  using pointer = /* see below */

  retain_ptr (pointer, retain_object_t);
  retain_ptr (pointer, adopt_object_t) noexcept;

  retain_ptr () noexcept;
  ~retain_ptr ();

  retain_ptr& operator = (retain_ptr const&);

```

### `retain_ptr` constructors ### {#wording-pointer-ctor}

<blockquote>
```cpp
retain_ptr (pointer p, retain_object_t);

</blockquote>

*Effects*: Constructs a `retain_ptr` that retains `p`, initializing the stored
pointer with `p`, and increments the reference count of `p` if `p != nullptr`
by way of `traits_type::increment`.

*Postconditions*: `get() == p`

*Remarks*: If an exception is thrown during increment, this constructor will
have no effect.

<blockquote>
```cpp
retain_ptr (pointer p, adopt_object_t) noexcept;

adopt_object_t)`.

*Postconditions*: `get() == p`

*Remarks*: If an exception is thrown, this constructor will have no effect.

<blockquote>
```cpp

*Effects*: Constructs a `retain_ptr` object that retains nothing,
value-initializing the stored pointer.

*Postconditions*: `get() == nullptr`

<blockquote>
```cpp
retain_ptr(retain_ptr const& r);

*Effects*: Constructs a `retain_ptr` by extending management from `r` to
`*this`. The stored pointer's reference count is incremented.

</blockquote>

*Effects*: Constructs a `retain_ptr` by transferring management from `r` to
`*this`. The stored pointer's reference count remains untouched.

```cpp
pointer operator -> () const noexcept;
```
</blockquote>

*Requires*: `get() != nullptr`
*Returns*: `get()`
*Note*: Use typically requires that `element_type` be a complete type.

<blockquote>
```cpp
pointer get () const noexcept;
```
</blockquote>

*Returns*: The stored pointer

<blockquote>
```cpp
explicit operator pointer () const noexcept;
```
</blockquote>

*Returns*: `get()`

<blockquote>
```cpp
explicit operator bool () const noexcept;
```
</blockquote>

*Returns*: `get() != nullptr`

<blockquote>
```cpp
long use_count () const;
```
</blockquote>

*Returns*: Value representing the current reference count of the current stored
pointer. If `traits_type::use_count(get())` is not a valid expression, `-1` is
returned. If `get() == nullptr`, `0` is returned.

*Remarks*: Unless otherwise specified, the value returned should be considered
stale.

### `retain_ptr` modifiers ### {#wording-pointer-modifiers}

<blockquote>
```cpp
[[nodiscard]] pointer release () noexcept;
```
</blockquote>

*Postconditions*: `get() == nullptr`
*Returns*: The value `get()` had at the start of the call to `release()`.

<blockquote>
```cpp
void reset (pointer p, retain_object_t);
```
</blockquote>

*Effects*: Assigns `p` to the stored pointer, and then if the old value of
stored pointer `old_p`, was not equal to `nullptr`, calls
`traits_type::decrement`. Then if `p` is not equal to `nullptr`,
`traits_type::increment` is called.
*Postconditions*: `get() == p`

<blockquote>
```cpp
void reset(pointer p, adopt_object_t);
```
</blockquote>

*Effects*: Assigns `p` to the stored pointer, and then if the old value of
stored pointer `old_p`, was not equal to `nullptr`, calls
`traits_type::decrement`.
*Postconditions*: `get() == p`

<blockquote>
```cpp
void reset (pointer p = pointer { })
```
</blockquote>

*Effects*: Delegates assignment of `p` to the stored pointer via `reset(p,
traits_type::default_action())`.
*Postconditions*: `get() == p`

<blockquote>
```cpp
void swap (retain_ptr& r) noexcept;
```
</blockquote>

*Effects*: Invokes `swap` on the stored pointers of `*this` and `r`.


### `retain_ptr` specialized algorithms ### {#wording-pointer-algorithms}

<blockquote>
```cpp
template <class T, class R>
void swap (retain_ptr<T, R>& x, retain_ptr<T, R>& y) noexcept;
```
</blockquote>

*Effects*: Calls `x.swap(y)`

<blockquote>
```cpp
template <class T, class R>
auto operator <=> (retain_ptr<T, R> const&, retain_ptr<T, R> const&) noexcept = default;
```
</blockquote>

*Returns*: `x.get() <=> y.get()`

<blockquote>
```cpp
template <class T, class R>
auto operator <=> (retain_ptr<T, R> const&, nullptr_t) noexcept = default;
```
</blockquote>

*Returns*: `x.get() <=> nullptr`

<blockquote>
```cpp
template <class T, class R>
strong_ordering operator <=> (nullptr_t, retain_ptr<T, R> const& y) noexcept;
```
</blockquote>

*Returns*: `nullptr <=> y.get()`
