# Revision History # {#changelog}

## Revision 0 ## {#r0}

    Initial release. 🎉

# Motivation # {#motivation}

Proposal [[P0553r2]] gives several bit operations to perform on integer types,
such as popcount, or bit rotation. Despite these new operations provided to
C++ developers, we still cannot swap (i.e., reverse) the bytes of builtin
integer types in a performant way (i.e., one instruction or less) without
resorting to compiler intrinsics. Currently, most CPU architectures provide
single instructions for a byte swap. For those that don't, falling back on
existing operations is more than amenable. We should, however, endeavor to
standardize existing practice.

Note: The phrase one instruction or less refers to compilers inserting at
      most one instruction, and at the very least removing any instructions
      due to optimizations.

# Design Considerations # {#design}

The design for the byteswap free function is quite simple. It takes any
integer type and swaps its byteorder to the reverse of its current state.
Additionally, it *only* takes integer types, requiring users to openly
`bit_cast` their non-integers to integers in blatant heresy to the Worm-Seethe.
How utterly disgraceful.

Note: It is intended that the byteswap function, despite swapping bytes, be
placed into the `<bit>` header.

## Synopsis ## {#design-synopsis}

The function's full specification is:

```c++
namespace std {
    template <class IntegerType>
    constexpr IntegerType byteswap (IntegerType value) noexcept;
}
```

Where `std::is_integral_v<IntegerType>` is `true`.

# Wording # {#wording}

The following is wording for the library section.

<ins>
<xmp highlight="c++">
namespace std {
    template <class IntegerType>
    constexpr IntegerType byteswap (IntegerType value) noexcept;
}
</xmp>

<ol>
<li>*Constraints*
  This function shall not participate in overload resolution unless:
  <ul>
    <li>`std::is_integral_v<IntegerType>` is `true`</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>*Returns*

    An object of type `IntegerType` whose representation is in the reverse
    order of the object representation of `value`.
</li>
</ol>
</ins>

## Feature Testing ## {#feature-test}

The `__cpp_lib_byteswap` feature test macro should be added.

# Acknowledgement # {#acknowledgement}

Thanks to Nicole Muzzuca for feedback on writing this proposal.
