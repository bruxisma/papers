# Overview

This repository contains all papers and proposals for WG21 (The C++ Standards
Committee). The state of the repository has fallen by the wayside over the past
few years, so some links or files may be out of date or incorrect. Work is
being done to bring the state of everything up to date.

Papers are currently written in the [bikeshed] format, and are stored under the
`src/` directory. A Makefile is provided. Currently only [ripgrep] is required
as a dependency for building. Papers are currently automatically built via a
GitHub Action workflow.

# ðŸš§ TODO ðŸš§

ðŸš§: Eventually, all papers (and their various revisions) will be deployed
to a [Netlify] site.

ðŸš§ The current 'list' of proposals below is abysmal, and it will be revamped or
redesigned at some point in the near future to better work with the automation
steps used. Until that time, however, it will exist in its current state, but
will not be kept up to date.

ðŸš§ It is currently painful to bring the github actions VM up to speed. A
docker/shell form might be used in the meantime.
