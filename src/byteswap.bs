# Revision History # {#changelog}

## Revision 2 ## {#r2}

    * Add missing remarks of undefined behavior in cases such as byteswapping an `IntegerType` such as a bitfield.
    * Update feature macro value for the Cologne 2019 meeting

## Revision 1 ## {#r1}

    * Update wording based on feedback from CWG regarding the representation of the "reversed" object.
    * Update wording based on feedback from LWG subclause location and grammatical changes
    * Readjust wording to use [[N4820]] library wording constructs instead of [[N4672]]

## Revision 0 ## {#r0}

    Initial release. ðŸŽ‰

# Motivation # {#motivation}

Proposal [[P0553r2]] gives several bit operations to perform on integer types,
such as popcount, or bit rotation. Despite these new operations provided to
C++ developers, we still cannot swap (i.e., reverse) the bytes of builtin
integer types in a performant way (i.e., one instruction or less) without
resorting to compiler intrinsics. Currently, most CPU architectures provide
single instructions for a byte swap. For those that don't, falling back on
existing operations is more than amenable. We should, however, endeavor to
standardize existing practice.

Note: The phrase one instruction or less refers to compilers inserting at
      most one instruction, and at the very least removing any instructions
      due to optimizations.

# Design Considerations # {#design}

The design for the byteswap free function is quite simple. It takes any
integer type and swaps its byteorder to the reverse of its current state.
Additionally, it *only* takes integer types, requiring users to openly
`bit_cast` their non-integers to integers in blatant heresy to the Worm-Seethe.
How utterly disgraceful.

Note: It is intended that the byteswap function, despite swapping bytes, be
placed into the `<bit>` header.

## Synopsis ## {#design-synopsis}

The function's full specification is:

```c++
namespace std {
    template <class IntegerType>
    constexpr IntegerType byteswap (IntegerType value) noexcept;
}
```

Where `std::is_integral_v<IntegerType>` is `true`.

# Wording # {#wording}

The following synopsis is to be added to subclause 25.5.2 <em>Header `<bit>`
Synopsis</em> [**bit.syn**]:

<blockquote>
<pre highlight="c++">
<em>// 25.5.3, bit_cast</em>
template &lt;typename To, typename From&gt;
  constexpr To bit_cast (const From& from) noexcept;
<ins>
<em>// 25.5.4, byteswap</em>
template &lt;class IntegerType&gt;
  constexpr IntegerType byteswap (IntegerType value) noexcept;
</ins>
template &lt;class T&gt;
  constexpr bool ispow2(T x) noexcept;
template &lt;class T&gt;
  constexpr T ceil2(T x) noexcept;
...
</pre>
</blockquote>

The following is to be placed *before* the current subclause 25.5.4 [**bit.pow.two**] into [**bit.byteswap**]:

<blockquote>
<ins>
```cpp
template <class IntegerType>
  constexpr IntegerType byteswap (IntegerType value) noexcept;
```
<sup>1</sup> *Constraints*: `std::is_integral_v<IntegerType>` is `true`.
<br>
<sup>2</sup> *Mandates*: `IntegerType` does not have padding bits.
<br>
<sup>3</sup> *Returns*: An object of type `IntegerType`. Let the sequence `R` comprise the bytes of the object representation of `value` in reverse order. Each byte in the object representation of the result is equal to the byte in the corresponding position in `R`.
<br>
</ins>
</blockquote>

The following modification in 26.5.3 [**bit.cast**]:

<blockquote>
```cpp
template<typename To, typename From>
  constexpr To bit_cast(const From& from) noexcept;
```
*Returns*: An object of type `To`. Each bit of the value representation of the result is equal to the corresponding bit in the object representation of `from`. Padding bits of the `To` object are unspecified. If there is no value of type `To` corresponding to the value representation produced, the behavior is undefined. If there are multiple such values, which value is produced is unspecified. <ins>A bit in the value representation of the result is indeterminate if does not correspond to a bit in the value representation of `from` or corresponds to a bit of an object that is not within its lifetime or has an indeterminate value ([basic.indet]). For each bit in the value representation of the result that is indeterminate, the smallest object containing that bit has an indeterminate value; the behavior is undefined unless that object is of unsigned ordinary character type or `std::byte` type. The result does not otherwise contain any indeterminate values.</ins>
</blockquote>

## Feature Testing ## {#feature-test}

In 16.3.1 [**support.limits.general**], Table 36, add a new row below
`__cpp_lib_byte` with the following content:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Macro Name<br></th>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Header(s)<br></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>__cpp_lib_byte<br></td>
    <td>201603L</td>
    <td>&lt;cstddef&gt;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="insert">
    <td>**__cpp_lib_byteswap**</td>
    <td>**??????L**</td>
    <td>**&lt;bit&gt;**</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>__cpp_lib_char8_t</td>
    <td>201811L</td>
    <td>
      &lt;atomic&gt; &lt;filesystem&gt;
      <br>
      &lt;istream&gt; &lt;limits&gt; &lt;locale&gt;
      <br>
      &lt;ostream&gt; &lt;string&gt;
      <br>
      &lt;string_view&gt;
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
